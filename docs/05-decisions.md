# 05 — Decision ledger

Append only. Entries are never edited — a later entry supersedes an earlier
one and says so. Every locked choice gets a row before the code that depends
on it.

Format: **ID · date · decision · what was rejected · why.**

---

## D-0001 · Rust is the only language

**Decision.** One language, enforced by a CI extension allowlist plus a build
script check, not by convention.

**Rejected.** A mixed system with a native hot layer. That is what the
predecessor repository was, and the boundary between the two runtimes cost
roughly 2.6 µs per emitted trade in marshalling and object construction — a
cost that only exists because the boundary exists.

**Why.** A rule that lives in a document is negotiated in every pull request.
A rule that fails CI is not. Gate 1 has no sympathetic exception: the file
ends in `.rs` or the build is red.

---

## D-0002 · Fixed-stride store, addressed by arithmetic

**Decision.** 64-byte header, 56-byte records, `ptr = base + 64 + i·56`.
Read-only mapping, positional writes.

**Rejected.** A columnar format. It is excellent for analytical scans and
wrong for this shape of work: the sweep reads a contiguous slice once and then
does billions of arithmetic operations against it. Decoding a batch to reach
one bar is cost with no return.

**Why.** Three machine operations to locate any bar, and no library between
the request and the bytes.

---

## D-0003 · The read mapping is read-only; writes use positional syscalls

**Decision.** Never map a store file writable.

**Rejected.** A writable mapping, which is the obvious way to append.

**Why.** A writable mapping that exhausts disk space raises **SIGBUS** — a
signal, asynchronous, catchable by no construct in any language. The
predecessor system halted cleanly on a full disk. Adopting a writable mapping
would have been a strict regression while looking like an optimisation. This
was found by an adversarial failure audit, not by reasoning, which is why the
audit is part of the process rather than a one-off.

---

## D-0004 · A commit counter published last

**Decision.** The header holds `n_valid`. Append writes data, fsyncs,
then publishes the counter with a release store.

**Rejected.** Treating file length as the record count.

**Why.** File length grows the instant the first byte lands. A reader between
that instant and the last byte of the record sees a half-written record made
of plausible integers. The counter makes the torn state unobservable rather
than unlikely.

---

## D-0005 · One checksum per 4 KiB block

**Decision.** A sidecar CRC file, one entry per block, verified on read.

**Rejected.** No checksum. Also rejected: a whole-file checksum.

**Why.** A flipped bit in a raw `i64` price yields a different, plausible
price. There is no parse to fail and no structure to violate — the corruption
is silent and permanent. A whole-file checksum would detect it but only at
O(file) cost, which is not affordable on a read path.

---

## D-0006 · There is no sweep depth parameter

**Decision.** The sweep request type carries no `k` field. Depth ends where
the frequent frontier empties.

**Rejected.** A depth parameter with a dynamic default.

**Why.** That is exactly what the predecessor had, and it failed silently: the
frontier mask was 64 bits against a 74-condition vocabulary, so every real run
tripped a width guard and fell back to a hardcoded `k = [1, 2]` with pruning
disabled. Dynamic depth was unreachable on the only vocabulary that existed,
and nothing in the flag revealed it. A parameter that can be set can be set
wrongly, silently, by a fallback nobody reads. Removing the field removes the
class.

---

## D-0007 · Condition bit indices are frozen

**Decision.** Append only. A retired condition keeps its bit forever as a
tombstone that evaluates false.

**Rejected.** Renumbering to keep the table tidy.

**Why.** A stored result is a set of bit positions. Renumbering makes every
historical result silently mean something else, with byte-identical storage
and no test capable of noticing.

---

## D-0008 · `u128` mask with 54 free bits

**Decision.** The mask is `u128`. 74 live, 54 free.

**Rejected.** `u64`, which fits today's count only if the vocabulary never
grows — and it already grew past 64 once, which is how D-0006's failure
happened.

**Why.** Headroom that costs 8 bytes per mask and removes an entire failure
class is not a trade-off worth debating.

---

## D-0009 · The browser crate depends on `core` alone

**Decision.** `crates/web` lists exactly one dependency and compiles to
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`. CI gate 7 enforces it.

**Rejected.** Letting the browser crate reuse `store` types directly.

**Why.** There is no filesystem in WebAssembly. Without the constraint the
failure surfaces as a runtime panic in a browser instead of a compile error on
a laptop. The payoff is that every display rule is compiled twice from one
source, so the server and the browser cannot disagree.

---

## D-0010 · Prices are paisa integers

**Decision.** `i64` paisa everywhere. Floats appear in no price, cost, or P&L.

**Rejected.** Decimal-typed prices, and float prices.

**Why.** Integers are exact, comparable, hashable, and free. The tick grid is
two decimal places, so paisa loses nothing. Snapping happens once, at the
ingest boundary, half-up.

---

## D-0011 · Enriched fields live in a sibling file

**Decision.** Overlay values get their own file, own version, own stride,
addressed by the same index.

**Rejected.** Widening the base record.

**Why.** The base stride must be constant forever, or the addressing rule
acquires a version check and stops being three machine operations.

---

## D-0012 · Credentials are read-only and never minted here

**Decision.** Parameter Store SecureStrings, region `ap-south-1`, read-only. A
stale token is re-read. If the re-read returns the same dead value, the pull
halts loudly.

**Rejected.** Minting a fresh token locally on an auth failure.

**Why.** The token is shared with another system. A local mint invalidates
theirs. Halting is correct; helpfulness here is a fault.

---

## D-0013 · 2026-08-01 · No literal credential path in a tracked file

**Decision.** This repository is public. No tracked file contains a real AWS
Parameter Store path. `CLAUDE.md` §8 and `docs/00-charter.md` §4 carry only the
generic shape `/<org>/<env>/<vendor>/<field>`.

`crates/pull` compiles in exactly two things: the path *template* and the
*field* names (`api-key`, `totp-secret`, `access-token`, `client-id`). It
compiles in no `org`, no `env`, and no `vendor` segment. Those three are read
at process start from an untracked local configuration file:

```
$HOME/.brutex/credentials.toml
```

That file holds **path segments only — never a secret value.** The secret is
still read from Parameter Store and from nowhere else, which leaves D-0012
untouched. A missing file, an unreadable file, a malformed file, or a missing
segment **halts the pull loudly and names which segment was absent.** There is
no default, no environment-variable fallback, and no prompt — a fallback here
would silently point a pull at the wrong account, which is D-0006's failure
class wearing different clothes.

CI gate 1c greps every tracked file for a concrete `/<segment>/<env>/…` shape
and fails the build on a hit, so the redaction cannot decay back.

**Rejected — literal `const` strings in `crates/pull`.** The task that raised
this decision described the real paths as "constants in `crates/pull`, read
from a local untracked config file, never committed". Those two clauses
contradict each other: `crates/pull` is tracked, so a constant in it is
published to a public repository, which is precisely what the redaction exists
to stop. The contradiction was raised with the operator before this entry was
written and resolved in favour of runtime resolution with zero literals.

**Rejected — an environment variable for the path.** It is invisible in a
process listing's absence, it is inherited by children, and CLAUDE.md §8
already rules the mechanism out for the value. Applying a weaker rule to the
path than to the secret is an inconsistency someone would eventually exploit.

**Rejected — committing the config with the segments redacted at review time.**
Redaction by review is the thing gate 1c replaces. A rule that lives in a
document is negotiated in every pull request; a rule that fails CI is not.

**Why.** A Parameter Store path names an account, an environment, and a vendor
relationship. On a public repository that is reconnaissance handed over for
free, and it cannot be retracted once cloned — the path stays in the git
history of every fork. The cost of the runtime read is one file open at
process start, which is not on any hot path measured by gate 8.

---

## D-0014 · 2026-08-01 · The calendar is transcribed data carrying an evidence lane per date

**Decision.** `crates/core` holds the NSE/BSE calendar as Rust literals with
**zero dependencies and no runtime fetch**. Every date carries the lane it was
verified at — `Verified`, `Secondary`, or `Unverified` — and the lane is a
value in the type, not a comment. A sweep window that crosses an `Unverified`
date reports the fact rather than absorbing it.

This supersedes the `docs/00-charter.md` §3 row that listed the special
weekend sessions as 2021-01-30 and 2021-02-01. Both are wrong. 2021-01-30 has
zero bars in the lake and appears in no predecessor source; 2021-02-01 was an
ordinary Monday with a full 375-bar session, so it is a normal trading day and
not a special one. The correct and complete set is **2020-02-01, 2025-02-01,
2026-02-01** — the only three years since 2020 in which 1 February fell on a
weekend. All three show exactly 375 bars.

**Rejected — fetching the calendar from the exchange at runtime.** It makes
`core` depend on the network, which would break its zero-dependency rule and
make a sweep non-reproducible: the same run on two days could load two
calendars and produce two different `data_digest` values from identical bars.
The predecessor already proved the fetch unreliable — nineteen consecutive
attempts to read the 2026 circular returned HTTP 403.

**Rejected — inheriting the predecessor's holiday sets as verified.** They are
demonstrably incomplete. Four dates have zero bars across all three engine
instruments and appear in no holiday set, and a fifth is mis-dated by one day.
Copying them over with the `verified` label would promote an evidence lane
during a copy, which `docs/00-charter.md` §4 forbids in as many words.

**Rejected — silently adding the four disputed dates as holidays.** The lake
is strong evidence and it is not a circular. Golden Rule 1 says an unverified
fact is written `UNVERIFIED` and stopped at, not quietly promoted because it
looks right. They are carried in `docs/06-limits.md` §9 with their evidence.

**Why a lane per date rather than one lane for the file.** The 2020–2025
dates are individually checkable against bars; the whole of 2026 is
secondary-sourced and one of its dates is already disputed by data. A single
file-level lane would have to take the worst case and would mark 2024 as
unreliable as 2026, which is false and would make the field useless. The lane
is the finest granularity that is honest.

## D-0015 · 2026-08-01 · Minute bars only until a minute-level result earns the upgrade

**Decision.** The engine ingests **1-minute bars from the two brokers only**.
Second-level data, tick data, bid/ask, and the two paid CSV vendors are
**deferred until a minute-level sweep has produced a profitable result**. The
seams that make them cheap to add are built now; the data is not bought now.

**Rejected — buying the second-level data first.** Two live quotes exist:
₹1,15,050 for 6.5 years of NIFTY F&O at 1-second, and ₹3,04,787 for 7 years of
NSE F&O. Neither is recoverable if the minute-level hypothesis does not hold,
and nothing measured so far says it does — `docs/06-limits.md` §4 still records
that **a full production sweep has never been run**. Paying before that
sentence is replaced by a measurement is buying on an extrapolation.

**Rejected — deferring the seams as well.** The retrofit cost is what makes a
deferral expensive, so the seams are load-bearing today:

| Seam | Built now | Cost to switch on later |
|---|---|---|
| `timeframe_secs` is a `u32` of **seconds** | already the store header field; `1` is a legal value | none — no format change, no migration |
| Path is the index | `bars/<exch>/<seg>/<sym>/<tf>/<yyyy-mm>.bin`; `<tf>` becomes `1sec` | none — the first write creates the directory |
| Bid/ask/greeks live in the `.ovl` sibling | D-0011 already forbids widening the base record | none — own version, own stride, same index *i* |
| Per-vendor decode behind one seam | the two brokers already disagree (rows vs parallel columns), so the seam is forced to exist | one implementation per vendor |

**What this defers, and why that is a relief.** Fixed-stride addressing is O(1)
only on a **dense** grid. At 1-second there are 22,500 slots per session, so a
dense grid costs ~1.26 MB per instrument per day — roughly **1.5 TB for NIFTY
options alone** over 6.5 years, against ~100 GB sparse. Sparse storage turns
the timestamp→bar lookup into a search and breaks the repository's central
guarantee. That choice is genuinely hard, it is unavoidable at second-level,
and it does not arise at all at minute-level. Deferring the data defers the
dilemma honestly rather than pre-committing to an answer.

**Vendor facts captured now so they are not re-derived later** (evidence lane
attached; none of this is in the engine surface):

| Fact | Value | Lane |
|---|---|---|
| GDFL CSV columns | `Ticker,Date,Time,LTP,BuyPrice,BuyQty,SellPrice,SellQty,LTQ,OpenInterest`, header present, date `DD/MM/YYYY` | verified from a sample file |
| TrueData CSV columns | `YYYYMMDD, HH:MM:SS, LTP, Volume, OpenInterest, Bid, BidQty, Ask, AskQty` — **no header row** | verified from the vendor's own email |
| Column order differs | GDFL puts bid/ask **before** volume/OI; TrueData **after**. A positional reader silently swaps Open Interest with a bid price. | verified |
| TrueData row identity | **none** — the instrument is the *filename* only | verified from a sample |
| GDFL websocket identity | `OPTSTK_SBIN_28OCT2025_CE_860`, `OPTIDX_NIFTYNXT50_28OCT2025_CE_61900` | verified from vendor documentation |
| GDFL CSV identity | `NIFTY03JUL2522800CE.NFO` | verified from a sample |
| Naming conventions in play | **five, all mutually incompatible** — Groww symbol, Dhan numeric id, GDFL CSV, GDFL websocket, TrueData filename | verified |
| GDFL epoch fields | `LastTradeTime` / `ServerTime` are epoch **seconds** | documented |
| Excluded from the GDFL quote | Option Chain, Option Greeks | quoted |
| TrueData licence | forbids forwarding, resale, and commercial use | quoted |

**Why five naming conventions is the real reason the mapping layer exists.**
One canonical `InstrumentKey` that every vendor resolves *to* is not
architectural taste; with five incompatible spellings of the same contract, a
shared identity is the only thing that makes deduplication meaningful across
sources. That layer is built at minute-level, where there are only two
spellings to reconcile, and it is the thing that makes vendors three and four
cheap.

## D-0016 · 2026-08-01 · Track the latest stable toolchain, not a frozen one

**Decision.** `rust-toolchain.toml` moves from **1.85.0 to 1.97.1** — current
stable — and CI tooling installs its latest release rather than a pinned old
one. The toolchain is still checked in and still identical on every machine and
in CI; what changes is that it is kept current instead of left to age.

**Rejected — keeping 1.85.0.** It was pinned in February 2025 and had become
the binding constraint on everything else. Concretely, gate 3 could not run at
all:

1. `cargo-deny ^0.16` failed to *parse* the RUSTSEC advisory database:
   `RUSTSEC-2026-0109.md` uses TOML front-matter it rejects.
2. `cargo-deny 0.18.9` fixes that, but requires rustc **1.88.0**.
3. `cargo-deny 0.18.3` installs on 1.85.0 — and still cannot parse the
   database.

There was no version of the tool that both installed on the pinned toolchain
and did its job. The gate was not misconfigured; it was **impossible**. A
security gate that cannot run is worse than an absent one, because red starts
to mean "the tool is broken again" rather than "something is wrong".

**Rejected — floating `channel = "stable"`.** Reproducibility requires that
two machines resolve the same compiler. A named version keeps that guarantee;
only the number moves, and moving it stays a decision recorded here.

**Verified before landing, not assumed.** On 1.97.1: `cargo fmt --check`
clean, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, 14 tests
passing. `edition = "2024"` and `resolver = "3"` are unaffected;
`rust-version` moves to 1.97 to match.

**The general rule this sets.** Pinning is for *reproducibility*, not for
*avoidance*. A pin that is never advanced silently becomes a ceiling on tools,
lints and advisories — and the failure surfaces far from its cause, as it did
here: three separate commits chased a symptom in `deny.toml` and in the tool
version before the toolchain itself turned out to be the constraint.

## D-0017 · 2026-08-01 · NSE only; the swept surface narrows from three to two

**Decision.** The engine sweeps **`NSE-NIFTY` and `NSE-BANKNIFTY`**. BSE and
MCX are not pulled. `BSE-SENSEX` is no longer swept.

**Rejected — keeping `BSE-SENSEX`.** It is the shortest series by a wide
margin: the lake holds SENSEX from **2022-09-01** against 2020-01 for the two
NSE indices. Any three-instrument result is therefore silently capped at the
shortest history, and a window chosen to include SENSEX throws away 2 years 8
months of NIFTY and BANKNIFTY data without saying so. Dropping it removes the
cap rather than working around it.

**Rejected — deleting BSE data already on disk.** Append-only history applies
to the store, not only to condition bits. Existing SENSEX bars stay; the
engine simply will not sweep them, and `is_sweepable` says so in one place.

**Why this is a narrowing and still needs an entry.** Golden rule 2 previously
said the surface "does not widen" without a ledger entry. That was a gap: a
*narrowing* silently changes every historical comparison just as much, because
a result set produced over three instruments is not comparable with one
produced over two. The rule now reads "widen OR narrow", and this entry is the
first use of it.

---

## D-0018 · 2026-08-01 · Store every NSE instrument; sweep two until one earns the widening

**Decision.** `pull` fetches and stores **every NSE instrument** — 12,460 cash
and 78,163 F&O rows in the vendor's own instrument master, 90,623 in total.
The **sweep** stays at the two indices until a two-instrument sweep produces a
profitable result.

**Rejected — sweeping all NSE equities now.** Total sweep work is linear in
symbols: 2 → ~750 is **375× the compute**, paid before anything has been shown
to work. `docs/06-limits.md` §4 still records that a full production sweep has
never been run. The same discipline as D-0015: build the capability, defer the
spend.

**Rejected — storing only the two indices.** Storage is cheap and re-pulling
is not. With every NSE instrument on disk, widening the sweep later is one
ledger entry and **zero re-pulling**. Pulling narrowly now would make the
widening a multi-hour vendor-bound operation instead of a config change.

**What widening will require, and is not solved today.** Indices never split;
equities do. An unadjusted 1:5 split is a **fake 80% overnight crash**, and
every condition fires on it — `gap_down_day`, `bar_bearish`,
`close_below_ema200`, the whole bar-shape family. There is no corporate-action
handling anywhere in this design, and the lake survey never looked for one
because indices do not need it.

The offsetting gain, recorded so it is not forgotten: equities carry **real
traded volume**, so VWAP bits 52–53 stop abstaining. On the index surface they
are permanently dead by construction.

**Behaviour when a corporate action is met: refuse the window, loudly.** A
suspected split or bonus — an unexplained overnight gap beyond a threshold —
causes the sweep to **refuse that window and name the date**, rather than
producing a result built on a fake crash. This follows
`docs/00-charter.md` prohibition 6: degrade loudly and name the reason, or
refuse; never silently.

**Rejected — back-adjusting prices from a corporate-action feed.** It is what
charting vendors do and it is the eventual right answer, but none of the four
vendors has been *verified* to supply split and bonus records. Building on an
unverified source would put a fabricated price into the store, which is worse
than refusing. Upgrading later invalidates no stored bar, because raw prices
are what is stored.

**Rejected — sweeping raw prices and ignoring the problem.** Cheapest, and it
contradicts prohibition 6 outright. A spurious signal that looks real is the
failure mode this repository is organised against.

---

## D-0019 · 2026-08-01 · The vendor is the first path segment

**Decision.** Every vendor gets its own complete series. The store path gains
a vendor segment at the front:

```
bars/<vendor>/<exchange>/<segment>/<symbol>/<timeframe>/<yyyy-mm>.bin
bars/groww/NSE/INDEX/NIFTY/1min/2024-06.bin
bars/dhan/NSE/INDEX/NIFTY/1min/2024-06.bin
```

A vendor can be added, re-pulled, or deleted by touching one directory and
nothing else. No merge step, no precedence rule, no migration of anyone
else's data.

**Rejected — one canonical series with a provenance overlay.** Half the
storage, and it still records where each bar came from. But it needs a
precedence rule decided *before* any evidence exists about which vendor is
more accurate, and once merged a vendor cannot be cleanly removed — its bars
are already interleaved with everyone else's.

**Rejected — one series, first writer wins, no provenance.** Cheapest, and it
makes a vendor disagreement **invisible**. Two vendors handing over different
prices for the same minute is exactly the kind of silent failure charter
prohibition 6 exists to forbid.

**Why the cost is acceptable.** A doubled series doubles storage: NIFTY at
1-minute over 6.5 years is 34 MB, so two vendors is 68 MB. That is not a
number worth trading a correctness property for.

**Why O(1) is unaffected.** The path is still the index — one more string
segment in a join that was already a join. Locating a slice remains a path
construction and an open; no catalogue, no scan, no lookup. Adding a fifth
vendor creates a directory and changes no code.

---

## D-0020 · 2026-08-01 · A vendor disagreement refuses the window and names it

**Decision.** Both vendors' bars stay on disk. A cross-verification pass diffs
the two series bar for bar; any mismatch beyond the tick grid is reported
**loudly, with the exact timestamp and both values**, and the sweep **refuses
that window** rather than silently choosing a side.

**Rejected — primary vendor wins, log the difference.** Never blocks a run,
which is precisely the problem: it lets a sweep produce a ranked result over
data that another vendor disputes, and the dispute survives only as a log line
nobody reads. A result that looks clean but rests on contested prices is worse
than no result.

**Rejected — deciding the rule later.** Tempting, because there is no
measurement yet of how often the two vendors actually disagree. But the rule
has to exist before the first sweep runs, and "we will decide when it happens"
resolves in practice to whatever the code happens to do.

**Why refusal rather than repair.** There is no principled way to pick a
winner without external evidence. Both vendors claim to relay the same
exchange feed, so a disagreement means at least one is wrong and nothing on
this machine can say which. Refusing names the problem; picking hides it.

**Consistent with what is already decided.** This is the same shape as
D-0018's corporate-action rule — refuse the affected window and name the date
— and the same shape as `Paisa::from_rupees_half_up` refusing a non-finite
price rather than substituting one. A refusal is a fact; a substitution is a
fabrication.

---

## D-0021 · 2026-08-01 · The lake is the source of F&O history; neither broker is

**Decision.** Expired option and future history comes from the **existing lake
on local disk**. Vendor APIs backfill only what the lake is missing. No
historical F&O data is purchased.

**Measured, not assumed** — a full survey of `~/.brutex/lake/bars/NSE/FNO`:

| | |
|---|---|
| Contract directories | **116,086** — 115,927 options, 159 futures |
| NIFTY option contracts | **60,996**, expiring **2020-01-02 → 2026-08-25** |
| BANKNIFTY options | 54,931 |
| Underlyings | NIFTY and BANKNIFTY only — no single stocks |
| On disk | **18 GB**, 196,954 parquet files, **zero empty directories** |
| **Absent from BOTH live vendor masters** | **115,272 — 99.3%** |

Both brokers purge on expiry: the earliest index-option expiry in either live
master is **2026-08-04**, three days after this measurement. Relying on the
masters alone would lose 99.3% of the history that is already owned.

**Contract identity is preserved independently of the directory names.**
`~/.brutex/lake/registry.duckdb` holds a `contracts` table of **169,530 rows**
(`exch, underlying, expiry_date, contract_symbol, strike, side,
candle_status`), spanning NIFTY 2020-01-02 → 2026-12-29. **No on-disk
directory is unknown to the registry.**

**Option bars already carry computed greeks** — `iv, delta, gamma, theta,
vega, rho, spot_at_bar, t_years_used, rate_used, greeks_provenance_id` — 17
columns in total. The tick vendor quoted for this data **excludes greeks
explicitly**.

**Rejected — buying historical F&O.** Two quotes exist, ₹1,15,050 and
₹3,04,787, for a superset of data already on disk, minus the greeks.

**Rejected — refetching from the brokers.** 116,086 contracts against a rate
limit, to reproduce what is already local.

**The one real gap.** The registry knows **~15,900 contracts, almost entirely
expiry-year 2024**, that have no bars on disk. That — and only that — is what
a vendor backfill is for.

## D-0022 · 2026-08-01 · The converter is a numeric boundary, not a copy

**Decision.** The lake→store converter **converts**; it does not transfer
bytes. Two transformations are mandatory and each is a correctness boundary:

| Lake | Store |
|---|---|
| prices as `double` | **`i64` paisa** — `CLAUDE.md` §7 |
| `timestamp` INT64 µs **UTC** | same, but IST is UTC + 19,800 s at every display |

**Why this is recorded rather than assumed.** The lake stores option OHLC as
IEEE doubles. `CLAUDE.md` §7 says prices are paisa integers and never a float.
A converter written as a copy would carry doubles into a store whose entire
addressing and comparison model assumes integers. The spot survey measured the
maximum deviation of `x·100` from an integer at **9.3 × 10⁻¹⁰ paisa**, so the
conversion is exact — but it must actually happen.

**Rejected — widening the store record to hold a float.** D-0002 and D-0011
fix the 56-byte stride permanently.

---

## D-0023 · 2026-08-01 · Verified vendor capability for expired contracts

**Decision.** Recorded as verified external facts, with the route that
verified each, because two earlier claims in this session were wrong and were
corrected only by going to the live source.

| Fact | Route | Lane |
|---|---|---|
| Groww `/v1/historical/{expiries,contracts,candles}` exist; FNO **"available from 2020"**; `year` accepts **"2020 - current year"**; `groww_symbol` is constructible as Exchange·Symbol·`DDMmmYY`·Strike·`CE/PE/FUT`; 1-minute window **30 days** | `curl` on `groww.in`, server-rendered, three URLs with three distinct hashes and 24 content markers | verified |
| The Groww endpoint is live | `curl` → **`401 "Missing token in request."`** — not a 404 | verified |
| Dhan `/v2/charts/rollingoption`: **45 days** per call, intervals `1/5/15/30/60`, strike enum `ATM, ATM+10, ATM-10`, **last 5 years rolling**, index **and** stock options, returns IV/OI/spot | **live browser** on `docs.dhanhq.co` | verified |

**A correction inside this entry, kept rather than edited away.** An earlier
draft recorded Dhan's Data-API daily limit as 100,000, reasoning from release
notes in the local capture. The live page says **7,000**. That is a 14× error
in the direction that matters: at ~1,722 calls per underlying for a five-year
expired-options pull, 7,000/day allows roughly **four underlyings per day**,
not fifty-eight. The number was wrong because it came from the capture rather
than the source — the same failure this decision exists to prevent, committed
inside the decision itself.

**Two Dhan documentation URLs 404.** `/api/v2/rate-limit` and
`/api/v2/guides/rate-limit` are both dead; the live page is
`/api/v2/guides/rate-limits`. A URL that appears in a capture is not evidence
that it resolves.

**The method matters, and is part of the decision.** Dhan's documentation is a
JavaScript application: three different URLs return one byte-identical 33,884
byte shell to `curl`, containing **zero** content markers. Reading it without a
browser produced a mangled capture from which a **non-existent `ATM±3` rule**
was reconstructed and reported as fact. Groww's documentation is
server-rendered and `curl` receives it intact — but `groww.in` is blocked in
both browsers by policy, so `curl` is the only route available there.

**No vendor claim enters this repository without naming the route that
produced it.**
